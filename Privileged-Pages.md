Privileged Pages are the webpages that browser-makers consider as an entitled webpage/s where extensions are tasked to not work/have their functionality ceased entirely.

For Chromium - `chrome.google.com/webstore/*` 

- On the aformentioned webpage, ALL Chromium/Chrome extensions will cease their functionality.

For Firefox - `addons.mozilla.org/*`

- Just like Chrome, Firefox's WebExtensions will also cease to work on that page/s.
