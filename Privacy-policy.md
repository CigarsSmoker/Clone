uMatrix does not collect any data of any kind.

- uMatrix has no home server.
- uMatrix doesn't embed any kind of analytic hooks in its code.

The only time uMatrix connects to a remote server is to update the hosts files and other related assets. If you disable auto-update in the _"Hosts files"_ pane in the dashboard, uMatrix will not connect to any remote server, unless you click _"Update now"_ and only if there are assets deemed "out of date".

The project is currently hosted on `github.com`, which is owned by GitHub, Inc., and thus is unrelated to uMatrix.

That is all.
