User agent strings used for spoofing are not updated automatically, this is your responsibility. So I will paste here updated strings, and your are free to update yours by cutting and pasting these in your dashboard.

Volunteers are free to update this wiki page when they think it's necessary. Please keep the list below ten entries, beyond this is overkill. I use the site listed in there and just copy/paste the top-most ones.
