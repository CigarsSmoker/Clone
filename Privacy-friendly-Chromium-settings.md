Un-checking options in the _Privacy_ is a good idea if privacy is a primary concern.

To prevent _"New tab"_ from making any outbound network connection, you can select any search engine other then Google. You can even create a fake search engine using the `about:blank` page, which will be used when creating a _"New tab"_.

If ever you keep Google as the default search engine, you can still use ÂµMatrix to prevent outbound connections from the _"New tab"_ page.

Note that whatever you choose, you can always prefix your search in the address bar with the name of a specific search engine, press <Tab>, then type whatever search expression in order to use a specific search engine without having to change anything in _Settings_.
