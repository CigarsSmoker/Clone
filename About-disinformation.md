For some reasons uBlock/uMatrix are the targets of some weird grudge. The disinformation often propagandized is that uBlock/uMatrix do no really block network traffic. I [responded previously here](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Does-uBlock-block-ads-or-just-hide-them%3F) for uBlock.

I am going to add a bit more information about how you can check for yourself: just use Firefox's _Network_ tab in the developer console, this will tell what network requests went through.
